This repository contains the ML task of The Sparks Foundation Data Science and Business Analytics Internship.
The project aims to predict scores of students using supervised machine learning based on the number of hours studied by the student.
Link to the dataset : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdiPersonalWorks/Random/master/student_scores%20-%20student_scores.csv
It contains information about the students and the number of hours studied by them.
In this project I have built a linear regression model with 93% accuracy.
The task also included to answer a question i.e. to predict the score, if a student studies for 9.25 hours/day.
The solution to the above question is well predicted in this project.
